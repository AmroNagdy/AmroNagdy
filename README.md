# About 👨‍💻
I'm currently working as a Data & API Engineer at Goldman Sachs, dealing with vast amounts of daily financial data and always looking for new ways to process and distribute that data. In my spare time I'm interested in finding novel methods for visualising relationships in data to draw meaningful insights or interesting narratives.
You can contact me and learn more about what I do at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amro-nagdy-453131b3/), and see how I solve a variety of problems at [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/amronagdy/).
